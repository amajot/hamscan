# HamScan

This is an extremely crude website crawling utility that scans 2 specific websites (QRZ & QTH) for deals on ham radio equipment. Given a list of search terms it will query the sites, parse the DOM, insert listings of interest into a mysql database, and then email me with any results. 

I originally had eham in here too, but they recognized the bot traffic and blacklisted my IP.

This was developed in 2 or 3 hours as a way to let me pounce on good deals. I have bought over a dozen things as a direct result of this app since installing this on my Raspberry Pi - it has really improved my dealmaking capacity!
